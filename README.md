# Leaf Classification competition on Kaggle

The objective of this playground competition is to use binary leaf images and extracted features, including shape, margin & texture, to accurately identify 99 species of plants. 


The dataset consists approximately 1,584 images of leaf specimens (16 samples each of 99 species) which have been converted to binary black leaves against white backgrounds. Three sets of features are also provided per image: a shape contiguous descriptor, an interior texture histogram, and a Ô¨Åne-scale margin histogram. For each feature, a 64-attribute vector is given per leaf sample.
